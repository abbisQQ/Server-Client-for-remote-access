# Server-client-for-remote-acces
A server client project which i made with python 3 both for demonstration perposes and to remote some task in my desktop while i am using my laptop .
In sort you can:
                get the current working directory
                change directories and move around
                see a list of folders and files
                read white and execute a file in python
                make and delete dilectories and files
                open and close the browser
                and finally restart or shut down the system.
      
The thing i like the most is that you can create files, write python code in them and execute them as python scripts will all the possibilities that this includes.
